## Local Setup
- Use RVM to create a gemset across Ruby version 2.6.0 using the command `rvm use 2.6.0@commit-bridge --create`
- Clone the repo
- Install the dependencies using the command `bundle install`
- Install the precommit hooks using
```
overcommit --install
overcommit --sign
```
- The database can be created using the command `rake db:create`
- generate the schema using `rake db:migrate`
- The Active Admin related seed data can be generated using the command `   `
- You can start the server using `rails s` or use the Rails console `rails c`
- ActiveAdmin is installed for having a visual representation of the data. Log in the admin panel at
`localhost:3000/admin` using the `secure` credentials
```
username: admin@commit-bridge.com
password: commit-bridge-123
```

## Application Details
- The Entity relationship diagram is present [over here](https://github.com/darth-dodo/commit-bridge/blob/master/erd.pdf)
- The ERD is autogenerated after every `rails db:migrate`


### Good to haves:
- Using [`JSON validator`](https://github.com/mirego/activerecord_json_validator) to validate the payload before saving in the model
- PaperTrail in case of changing the data
